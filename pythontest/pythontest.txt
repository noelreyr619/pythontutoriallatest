1. Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

my_str = input("Enter a string: ")

# breakdown the string into a list of words
words = my_str.split()

# sort the list
words.sort()

# display the sorted words

print("The sorted words are:")
for word in words:
   print(word)

2. Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

s = input()
d={"DIGITS":0, "LETTERS":0}
for c in s:
    if c.isdigit():
        d["DIGITS"]+=1
    elif c.isalpha():
        d["LETTERS"]+=1
    else:
        pass
print "LETTERS", d["LETTERS"]
print "DIGITS", d["DIGITS"]

3. Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com" format, please write program to print the user name of a given email address. Both user names and company names are composed of letters only.

import re
emailAddress = raw_input()
pat2 = "(\w+)@((\w+\.)+(com))"
r2 = re.match(pat2,emailAddress)
print r2.group(1)

4. Please write a program using list comprehension to print the Fibonacci Sequence in comma separated form with a given n input by console.
def f(n):
    if n == 0: return 0
    elif n == 1: return 1
    else: return f(n-1)+f(n-2)

n=int(raw_input())
values = [str(f(x)) for x in range(0, n+1)]
print ",".join(values)

5.Write a binary search function which searches an item in a sorted list. The function should return the index of element to be searched in the list.

import math
def bin_search(li, element):
    bottom = 0
    top = len(li)-1
    index = -1
    while top>=bottom and index==-1:
        mid = int(math.floor((top+bottom)/2.0))
        if li[mid]==element:
            index = mid
        elif li[mid]>element:
            top = mid-1
        else:
            bottom = mid+1

    return index

li=[2,5,7,9,11,17,222]
print bin_search(li,11)
print bin_search(li,12)

6. Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female class.
class Person(object):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Unknown"

class Male( Person ):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Male"

class Female( Person ):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Female"

aMale = Male()
aFemale= Female()
print aMale.getGender()
print aFemale.getGender()

7.Python Program that Reads a Text File and Counts the Number of Times a Certain Letter Appears in the Text File
fname = input("Enter file name: ")
l=input("Enter letter to be searched:")
k = 0
 
with open(fname, 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        words = line.split()
        for i in words:
            for letter in i:
                if(letter==l):
                    k=k+1
print("Occurrences of the letter:")
print(k)

8. Python Program to Remove the Duplicate Items from a List

a=[]
n= int(input("Enter the number of elements in list:"))
for x in range(0,n):
    element=int(input("Enter element" + str(x+1) + ":"))
    a.append(element)
b = set()
unique = []
for x in a:
    if x not in b:
        unique.append(x)
        b.add(x)
print("Non-duplicate items:")
print(unique)
